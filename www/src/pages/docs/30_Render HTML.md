## Overview

### Create a Basic UI

fritz2 offers a rich DSL to create the HTML for your application. Simply call the global `render` function to 
create an initial `RenderContext`, then use the HTML-Tag factory-functions provided by fritz2, 
like `div`. All of those factories have to be nested by intention, so this results in a *declarative* way of creating
UIs.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    render { // offers created root `RenderContext` - start your UI code in here
        
        // create an HTML tag; `div` produces a `Tag` which is also a `RenderContext`.
        // This enables nested calling and therefore the declarative approach
        div(id = "header") {
            
        }
        div(id = "container") {
            h1 { +"Hello World!" }
            //   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
            //   create a text node inside a tag
        }
        div(id = "footer") {

        }
    }
}
```

This code results in:

```html
<body id="target">
    <div id="header"></div>
    <div id="container">
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="footer"></div>
</body>
```

If you compare the result with the code, you will immediately recognize that the DOM structure is reflected by the 
declaring code. This leads to easy to read UI definitions and is a core feature of fritz2.

### Make Your UI Reactive

fritz2 supports reactive UIs as one of its core features, so let us enhance the example with some dynamic content.

First of all, we need a so-called `Store` for holding the dynamic data of our application. Such stores are the heart
of every fritz2 application; they provide the current value in a reactive way and handle all the data changes.

:::info
The store creation and its core functionalities will be explained in-depth in [chapter](/docs/createstores). 
So do not fret about the details - the facts relevant to understanding this chapter are explained here. 
:::

The store's `data`-property offers a `Flow` of the stored value `T`. To reactively bind this value to the DOM, 
use one of the `render*`-functions of the data flow on it. The function creates a so-called *mount-point* which manages 
the automatic update of the DOM on every change of the store's data. The *mount-point* uses a dedicated tag created in 
the DOM as reference to the node where the deletion and recreation of the defined UI-fragment happens.

To react to (user) events like the click onto a button, a store provides so-called `Handler`s, which create the new
value of the store. The default and built-in handler `update` simply substitutes the old state with a new value.

:::info
Events and reacting to them will be explained in-depth in another chapter. The next example contains short commentary
on this topic only to help you understand the example.
:::

```kotlin
fun main() {
    render {
        // define a store to hold the dynamic data, in this case a `String`
        val storedName = storeOf("World")

        div(id = "header") {
        }
        div(id = "container") {
            storedName.data.render { name -> // current value is provided
                //          ^^^^^^
                //          create a "mount-point" to bind the store's data to a node in the DOM
                //          every time the data changes, this inner UI-subtree gets deleted and newly created
                h1 {
                    +"Hello, "
                    +name // use the provided data here
                    +"!"
                }
            }
        }
        div(id = "footer") {
            button {
                +"Greet fritz2"
            }.clicks.map { "fritz2" } handledBy storedName.update
            // ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                      ^^^^^^
            // use the event to send a new                 use store's default handler
            // value to the store                          to replace the old with the new value
            // Event handling will be explained in the chapter about store creation!
        }
    }
}
```

The DOM structure now looks as follows:
```html
<body id="target">
<div id="header"></div>
<div id="container">
    <div class="mount-point" data-mount-point="">
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="footer">
    <button>Greet fritz2</button>
</div>
</body>
```

When you click the button, the whole `h1`-subtree will be removed and changed to `<h1>Hello, fritz2!</h1>`

### Style and Enrich Your UI with Attributes

As a final teaser, we would like to demonstrate the styling of a UI and setting attributes of a tag.

The tag-factories accept static CSS-classes as a `String` as first parameter, as this is such a common use case (this is 
why we used the named parameter for the ids throughout previous chapters).
fritz2 is totally agnostic of any CSS-framework or even handcrafted CSS - use whatever fits your needs!

:::info
fritz2 is totally agnostic of any specific CSS technology. At least there are the following possibilities you can apply:
1. Use your custom handcrafted static CSS by adding a CSS-file under `jsMain/resources` and embed it in 
the `jsMain/resources/index.html` file.
2. Use static CSS from [CDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CDN) 
(e.g. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/#quick-start)) - include it
appropriately inside the `jsMain/resources/index.html` file.
3. Use dynamic CSS with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) by using our 
[ready-to-use template](https://github.com/jwstegemann/fritz2-tailwind-template).
4. Use any other dynamic CSS by configuring [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/#styling) appropriately.
:::

Since being reactive is such an important aspect of fritz2, styling and attributes can be set based upon the store's 
state. Example:
A button is reactively disabled when it is clicked because the click changes the state of the store. 
The changed state (its data) is evaluated inside the `disabled`-function which sets the related property of 
the `<button>`-tag. 

All the building blocks we showcased here make fritz2 a fully reactive web framework.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    render {
        val storedName = storeOf("World")

        div("w-48 m-4 flex flex-col gap-2") {
            // ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
            // set (static) CSS classnames as first parameter of a tag factory
            div(id = "header") {
            }
            div(id = "container") {
                h1 {
                    +"Hello, "
                    storedName.data.render { name ->
                        span(if (name == "fritz2") "font-bold" else "") {
                            // ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                            // set classname depending on the store's content
                            +name
                        }
                        +"!"
                    }
                }
            }
            div(id = "footer") {
                button("p-2 text-white border border-1 border-gray-300 rounded-md") {
                    +"Greet fritz2"
                    className(storedName.data.map { if (it == "fritz2") "bg-gray-500" else "bg-blue-400" })
                    //        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                    //        set CSS classes reactively
                    disabled(storedName.data.map { it == "fritz2" })
                    //       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                    //       set disabled attribute reactively
                }.clicks.map { "fritz2" } handledBy storedName.update
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The final DOM structure now looks like this:
```html
<body id="target">
<div class="w-48 m-4 flex flex-col gap-2">
    <div id="header"></div>
    <div>
        <h1>Hello,
            <div class="mount-point" data-mount-point="">
                <span>World</span>!
            </div>
        </h1>
    </div>
    <div>
        <button class="p-2 bg-blue-400 text-white border border-1 border-gray-300 rounded-md">
            Greet fritz2
        </button>
    </div>
</div>
</body>
```

Clicking the button will change the button section to this:
```html
<button disabled class="p-2 bg-gray-500 text-white border border-1 border-gray-300 rounded-md">
    Greet fritz2
</button>
```
Pay attention to the changed CSS-classes and the added `disabled` attribute! 

(tailwindcss users might recognize a better approach for this case: the usage of the `disabled:` prefix. This would make 
the `className` call obsolete and shorten the code - so please accept this solution for demonstration purposes
only.)

## Essentials

Before we dive into the essential topics, let us introduce some model types we will use in our upcoming examples:
```kotlin
// example of an entity
data class Person(
    val id: Int, // stable identifier
    val name: String,
    val age: Int
)

// example of some value type
enum class Interest {
    Programming,
    Sports,
    History,
    WritingDocumentation
}
```

### Reactive Rendering

As you already know, all [state handling](/docs/fundamentals/#state-handling) is done with `Store`s in fritz2.

Based upon the `data`-property, which provides a `Flow` of the store's generic data type, there are a variety of
`render*`-functions which can be used to create *reactive* UIs:

| Render-Function             | Additional parameters | Description                                                                                                                   | Default Tag |    
|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `Flow<T>.render`            | -                     | Creates a mount-point providing the whole store's data value `T` inside `content` expression                                  | `div`       |
| `Flow<T>.renderIf`          | predicate             | Creates a mount-point providing the whole store's data value `T` inside `content` expression when `predicate` is `true`       | `div`       |
| `Flow<Boolean>.renderTrue`  | -                     | Creates a mount-point rendering the `content` expression with no store data provided when the flow's value is `true`          | `div`       |
| `Flow<Boolean>.renderFalse` | -                     | Creates a mount-point rendering the `content` expression with no store data provided when the flow's value is `false`         | `div`       |
| `Flow<T>.renderNotNull`     | -                     | Creates a mount-point providing the whole store's data value `T` inside `content` expression when `T` is not `null`           | `div`       |
| `Flow<T>.renderIs`          | klass                 | Creates a mount-point providing the whole store's data value `T` inside `content` expression when `T` is of type `klass`      | `div`       |
| `Flow<String>.renderText`   | -                     | Creates a mount-point creating a text-node                                                                                    | `span`      |
| `Flow<List<T>>.renderEach`  | -                     | Creates a mount-point optimizing changes by `T.equals`. Provides a `T` inside the `content` expression. Use for value objects | `div`       |
| `Flow<List<T>>.renderEach`  | idProvider            | Creates a mount-point optimizing changes by `idProvider`. Provides a `T` inside the `content` expression. Use for entities    | `div`       |

There is one more `renderEach` variant which is defined as an extension to a `Store` instead of a `Flow`.
This special variant and its application are described in the 
[chapter about store mapping](/docs/storemapping/#reactive-rendering-of-entity-lists-with-auto-mapped-element-store).

| Render-Function             | Additional parameters | Description                                                                                                                       | Default Tag |    
|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `Store<List<T>>.renderEach` | idProvider            | Creates a mount-point optimizing changes by `idProvider`. Provides a `Store<T>` inside the `content` expression. Use for entities | `div`       |

#### Reactive Rendering of `T`

Use the `render`-function to render the store's data type as a whole.
It requires a lambda expression with a `Tag` as receiver (remember that a `Tag` *is* a `RenderContext`), providing the
data as a parameter and returning `Unit`. Inside this `content` parameter, you then have access to the current data
and can use all HTML tag factories to create the desired UI-fragment.

```kotlin
render {
    // define a Person and "store" it
    val storedPerson = storeOf(Person(1, "Fritz", 42))

    storedPerson.data.render { person -> // the current store's value is injected
        dl {
            dt { +"Id" }
            // use the data type to render its contents by accessing its properties
            // as the DOM consists only of strings, we must take care of the needed type conversion from `Int` to `String`
            dd { +person.id.toString() }
            dt { +"Name" }
            dd { +person.name }
            dt { +"Age" }
            dd { +person.age.toString() }
        }
    }
}
```

As a result, the following DOM-fragment is rendered:
```html
<div class="mount-point" data-mount-point="">
    <dl>
        <dt>Id</dt>
        <dd>1</dd>
        <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd>Fritz</dd>
        <dt>Age</dt>
        <dd>42</dd>
    </dl>
</div>
```

The `render`-function creates a *mount-point* which reactively connects a store's data with 
a node in the DOM-tree. The created mount-point now takes care of reacting to new values and keeps the UI-fragment up 
to date. This is the upper part of fritz2's [circle of life](/docs/fundamentals/#understanding-the-circle-of-life).

It is important to know the following facts about `render` and mount-points:
- As default, a special `<div>` tag is rendered which is marked with the purely informational `data-mount-point`
attribute. It also has a special CSS class `mount-point` which simply sets the display mode to `contents` in order to
exclude this artificial tag from the visible UI.
- On every change to the store's data, the **whole subtree** beneath that `<div>` tag is dropped and rebuilt with the
new data's content.

:::info
As a direct consequence of the last fact, we recommend keeping the reactive UI-fragments as minimal as you can,
since re-rendering a subtree is work for the browser. 

fritz2 supports you in doing so, for example by
- [precisely rendering complex / hierarchical data structure](#minimize-dom-structure-changes-within-reactive-updates-aka-precise-rendering) 
- [efficiently rendering lists](#reactive-rendering-of-lists-of-value-objects)
- 
As rule of thumb, the smaller the changing parts are, the faster the result will be.
:::

Also, take a look at our [basic example](/examples/gettingstarted/) which demonstrates the `render` function.

#### Reactive Rendering of Text-Nodes

Since creating a reactive UI with dynamically rendered texts is a common use case, 
fritz2 offers a *dedicated* render variant called `renderText`
on data flows of type `String`:

```kotlin
render {
    val storedText = storeOf("fritz2")

    div {
        // attention: needs a *Tag*, not just a `RenderContext`
        storedText.data.renderText()
    }
}
```

As result the following DOM-fragment is rendered:
```html
<div>
    <span>fritz2</span>
</div>
```

There is also an extension function `asString` which converts a `Flow<T>` to a `Flow<String>` by calling the 
`toString` method internally:

```kotlin
render {
    val storedCount = storeOf<Int>(0)

    div {
        storedCount.data.asString().renderText()
    }
}
```

The `renderText` function is useful when long text has smaller dynamic parts. 
Since only the smaller parts will change, the other parts must not be part of the mount-point:

```kotlin
render {
    val storedText = storeOf("fritz2")

    p {
        +"There is an excellent Kotlin based framework named "
        storedText.data.renderText() // only the dynamic part is here; the other text-nodes are static
        +" which empowers one to easily create reactive SPAs in pure Kotlin."
    }
}
```

Imagine a `render` based solution on the contrary:
```kotlin
render {
    val storedText = storeOf("fritz2")

    p {
        storedText.data.render { frameworkName ->
            +"There is an excellent Kotlin based framework named "
            +frameworkName
            +" which empowers one to easily create reactive SPAs in pure Kotlin."
        }
    }
}
```
Of course the former could also have been written with `String`-templating instead of separate text-nodes.

The important advantages of the dedicated `renderText` solution compared to the general `render` based solution are:
- The `renderText` solution fits better to the *declarative* UI approach, as it better reflects the node structure
and thus is better to read.
- The mount-point encompasses a much smaller DOM-subtree, so it is more efficient.

#### Reactive Rendering of Lists of Value Objects

Since a store of `List<T>` is a common use case, fritz2 offers a special `renderEach` function for this as well:

```kotlin
render {
    // define a store with some type of `List<T>`
    val storedInterests = storeOf(Interest.values().toList())

    ul {
        // for every value of store's interest list, the provided `content` expression is executed
        storedInterests.data.renderEach { interest -> // the current applied value of the data flow
            // just declare the UI for one item to render the complete list accordingly
            li {
                +interest.toString()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

As a result, the following DOM-fragment is rendered:
```html
<div class="mount-point" data-mount-point="">
    <li>Programming</li>
    <li>Sports</li>
    <li>History</li>
    <li>WritingDocumentation</li>
</div>
```

It is important to spot the main difference to the former render-functions: The store's data type is an (ordered)
collection type, so its value consists of an arbitrary amount of elements of the same type. 
An inherent property of equal types is that their UI-representation is also of the same type. `renderEach` supports
this by describing only the UI-fragment for *one* item of the list with the `content` parameter.
The UI-container which holds those items is therefore *not* part of the reactive expression and thus the
mount-point.

Another important aspect of handling the reactive rendering of `List`s is *performance*
optimization.

In order to gain some understanding for this technical aspect, consider the above example realized with the standard
`render`-function:

```kotlin
render {
    val storedInterests = storeOf(Interest.values().toList())

    ul {
        storedInterests.data.render { interests -> // name suggests a list
            // "manually" create <li> tags for each item
            interests.forEach {
                li {
                    +it.toString()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You cannot spot the difference by looking at the rendered DOM structure because it remains the same for both solutions.
But looking at the code, we can conclude that the second approach will definitely delete the whole subtree of the 
mount-point and re-create all `<li>`-tags, even if only *one* element of the list changes.

`renderEach` instead creates a specialized mount-point in order to identify elements for re-rendering.
This mount-point compares the current version of your list with the new one on every change and applies the minimum
necessary patches to the DOM. Assuming only one item changes, the untouched items can remain in the DOM, 
and only the changed item's DOM subtree needs to be deleted and recreated. As you can imagine, this is a game changer
concerning performance.

This `renderEach` implementation does the patch-determination by applying the standard `equals`-method of the list's 
type `T`. This is the reason why it is targeted to *value* objects - they are implicitly defined by their equality.

Have a look at its usage in our [master detail](/examples/masterdetail/) example.

#### Reactive Rendering of Lists of Entities

Since a `List<T>` as value of a store is a common use case, `T` being an *entity* with a stable identity, fritz2 
offers a specialized `renderEach`-function for it.
When dealing with entities, you can pass an additional parameter called `idProvider`. This expression takes
one item `T` and determines its stable identity. Armed with this information, the internal patch-determination is then
simply based upon the id and not upon the `equals`-method anymore.

```kotlin
// define some person-entities and store them
val persons = listOf(
    Person(1, "Fritz", 42),
    Person(2, "Caesar", 66),
    Person(3, "Cleopatra", 50)
)

render {
    val storedPersons = storeOf(persons)

    ul {
        storedPersons.data.renderEach(Person::id) { person ->
            //                        ^^^^^^^^^^
            //                        provide a function to determine the stable identity of one `T`
            li {
                dl {
                    dt { +"Id" }
                    dd { +person.id.toString() }
                    dt { +"Name" }
                    dd { +person.name }
                    dt { +"Age" }
                    dd { +person.age.toString() }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

As the identity is stable, the following properties hold for the rendered items:
- An element is only rendered *once*, so only adding or deleting items to the store will lead to changes in the UI.
- Any change to an existing item will *not* trigger any re-rendering action anymore.

The latter is an important aspect to consider before the use of `renderEach` for entities. If you still need to reflect 
changes to the data within an entity and want to apply precise rendering, use this application of `renderEach`, 
but add additional mount-points inside the elements subtrees. You will learn about those in the 
[chapter about store mapping](/docs/storemapping/#reactive-rendering-of-entity-lists-with-auto-mapped-element-store).

Otherwise, it might be a better choice to stick to the default `renderEach` application relying on equality.
Have a look at its application in our [todomvc](/examples/todomvc/) example.

### Apply Styling to Your UI: Reactive or Static

The `class` attribute of a `Tag` for working with CSS style-classes is somewhat special. You can set the static values
of each `Tag` for `class` and `id` by using the optional parameters of its factory function:

```kotlin
render {
    div("some-static-css-class") {
        button(id = "someId")
    }
}
```

Use this one-liner to add styling and meaning to your elements by using semantic CSS class-names. Also, it keeps your
code clean when using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.

Additionally, the `className`-function can be used to set static classes:

```kotlin
render {
    div {
        className("some-static-css-class")
        button(id = "someId")
    }
}
```

To reactively change the styling of a rendered element, you can add dynamic classes by assigning a `Flow` of strings to
the `className`-attribute (like with any other attribute).

```kotlin
render {
    val enabled = storeOf(true)

    div("common-css-class") {
        className(enabled.data.map {
            if (it) "enabled-css-class"
            else "disabled-css-class"
        })
        +"Some important content"
    }
}
```

You can also combine all of these approaches with arbitrary usages of `className`-variants to handle different aspects
separately:

```kotlin
render {
    val enabled = storeOf(true)
    val readonly = storeOf(true)

    div("common-css-class") {
        className("some-other-static-class")
        className(enabled.data.map {
            if (it) "enabled-css-class" 
            else "disabled-css-class"
        })
        className(readonly.data.map { if(it) "readonly-csss-class" else "" })
        +"Some important content"
    }
}
```

Keep in mind that the first value of a `Flow` might take some time to be consumed and applied to the `class` 
attribute of a tag. This could lead to flicker effects, for example with floating elements which only become
visible when activated. The following section explains how to overcome these effets.

### Avoid Flicker Effects With Reactive Styling

In order to avoid flicker effects caused by the delay of the first value becoming available on the flow, an initial 
value must be provided to be applied immediately within the rendering process.

The previously discussed `className`-function offers an `initial` parameter:
```kotlin
fun className(value: Flow<String>, initial: String): Unit
```

For single classes or short class name groups, simply pass the appropriate initial classnames as second 
parameter:
```kotlin
render {
    val enabled = storeOf(true)

    div("common-css-class") {
        className(enabled.data.map {
                if (it) "enabled-css-class"
                else "disabled-css-class"
            },
            initial = "enabled-css-class"
        )
        +"Some important content"
    }
}
```

For simple use cases this is fine, as long as the classnames for the initial state remain unchanged.
Otherwise the `initial = "..."`-parameter would also have to be changed, which can easily be overlooked.

That's why there is another `className`-function variant which might be better suited for more complex or volatile
initial class name values:
```kotlin
fun <T> className(value: Flow<T>, initial: T, transform: (T) -> String): Unit
```

This function takes three parameters in order to solve the above problem:
- `value` is a `Flow` which provides arbitrary values of `T`. This can be a simple `Flow<Boolean>`, but also
combinations or any other type can be provided.
- `initial`: a value of `T` representing the initial state to be applied immediately.
- `transform`: a lambda expression which uses one value of `T` in order to generate the appropriate class names for
this specific value.

The above problem is now solved by this function as the `transform`-expression is the *single source of truth* of all
class names. First, the `initial`-parameter is passed to the `transform`-expression to create the initial class names 
which are immediately applied. Further on, each value appearing on the `value`-`Flow` will be used with `transform`
to create the appropriate class names.

```kotlin
render {
    val enabled = storeOf(true)

    div("common-css-class") {
        className(enabled.data, initial = true) {
            if (it) "enabled-css-class"
            else "disabled-css-class"
        }
        +"Some important content"
    }
}
```

### Handle large Class Strings

CSS classes strings can become very long and may exceed the limit of a code line. This is especially true when working
with utility based CSS frameworks like [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).

For such situations you need to split up your string into feasible, shorter parts. For this use-case fritz2 offers 
the dedicated function `joinClasses(vararg classes: String?): String`. This functions accepts an arbitrary 
amount of `String`s and concatenates them together taking care of the needed white spaces:
```kotlin
// example uses tailwindcss classes
render {
    div(
        joinClasses(
            "relative z-10 flex justify-between items-start w-full my-2 p-4",
            "bg-primary-800 rounded-lg hover:bg-primary-900",
            "text-left text-white",
            "focus:outline-none focus:ring-4 focus:ring-primary-600",
        )
    ) {
        // some content
    }
}
```

Using this function, it is also possible to conditionally construct classes strings without having to do dangerous
string concatenation:

```kotlin
val someState = ...

val classes = joinClasses(
    "class1",
    "class2".takeIf { it.length > 10 },
    when(someState) {
        something.A -> "class3 class4 class5"
        something.B -> "class5"
        else -> "class6 class7"
    }
)
```

::: warning
You may be tempted to use Kotlin's default [multiline strings](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/strings.html#multiline-strings),
which is generally speaking totally ok. But be aware, that you have to deal with the correct handling of separating 
white spaces by your own! This can be quite error-prone though:
```kotlin
"""grid grid-rows-3 grid-cols-[auto_1fr] gap-1 p-4
   | text-base font-sans cursor-pointer rounded-md
   |focus:outline-none focus-visible:ring-4 focus-visible:ring-primary-600""".trimMargin()
//  ^
//  Missing Space -> would lead to class with name `rounded-mdfocus:outline-none` which will 
//                   lead to an error in appearance and might be hard to identify
```

A better approach could be the `joinToString`-Method of collection types, but it is unlikely that you already have
those classes inside some collection, so you would have to create some collection in place first, which is quite
expensive and ineffective.
:::

### Apply Attributes to Your UI: Reactive or Static

To create rich HTML interfaces, styling alone is not sufficient - you will need to use a variety of attributes.
In fritz2 there are several easy ways to do this, depending on your use case.

You can set all HTML attributes inside the `Tag`'s content by calling a function of the according name. Every standard
HTML attribute has two functions. One sets a static value every time the element is re-rendered, the second collects
dynamic data coming from a `Flow`. When coming from a `Flow`, the attribute's value will be updated in the
DOM whenever a new value appears on the `Flow`, no re-rendering required:

```kotlin
val flowOfInts = ... // i.e. get it from a store

render {
    input {
        placeholder("a text")
        maxLength(flowOfInts)
        disabled(true)
    }
}
```

If you want to set a `Boolean` value, you can use the optional parameter `trueValue` which will be set as the
attribute-value when your data is `true`:

```kotlin
val isLow = myStore.data.map { i -> i <= 0 }

render {
    button {
        +"My button"
        attr("data-low", isLow, trueValue = "true")
        // isLow == true  -> <button data-low="true">My button</button>
        // isLow == false -> <button>My button</button>
    }
}
```

This is sometimes needed for CSS-selection or animations.

::: info
The `className` function you have already encountered is just another way to set a common attribute on a tag. 
Internally, it offers more convenience variants and works a bit differently, due to its overall importance.
:::

To set a value for a custom (data-) attribute, use the `attr()`-function. It works for static and dynamic (from
a `Flow`) values:

```kotlin
render {
    div {
        attr("data-something", "value")
        attr("data-something", flowOf("value"))
    }
}
```

Sometimes it is important for an attribute to only appear if a certain condition is `true`. For example, some
[ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) properties like
[aria-controls](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-controls) should
preferably appear only if the dependent element exist. The `attr` functions for `Flows` behave in such a way - they
only set an attribute if the value is *not* `null`. This behaviour can be used to achieve the desired effect:

```kotlin
render {
    val isOpened = storeOf(true)

    button {
        +"Toggle"
        clicks handledBy isOpened.handle { !it }

        attr("aria-controls", isOpened.data.map { if (it) "disclosure" else null })
        //                                                                  ^^^^
        //                 attribute disappears if disclosure-div is not rendered
    }

    isOpened.data.render {
        if (it) {
            div(id = "disclosure") {
                +"I am open!"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Avoid Unsound Values with Reactive Attributes

As the first value of a `Flow` might appear some time after the DOM portion of some tag is already rendered, it is
possible that the initial value of an attribute is not set or set with the wrong value. This could lead to
further unwanted side effects if other behaviour or rendering is derived by those attributes. Think of a falsely
enabled `disabled` attribute of an `input` element, for example.

To immediately set any attribute, the respective attribute-method is simply called twice: First with the
static value to be set immediately, then with the `Flow` providing the dynamic values:

```kotlin
val disabled: Flow<Boolean> = ...

attr("disabled", "false")
attr("disabled", disabled) // the first value of the `Flow` will override the static value set before.
```

### Minimize DOM Structure Changes within Reactive Updates: Precise Rendering

In order to improve performance and memory-footprint, you should always try to keep the reactive parts of your
UI as small as possible. This can be achieved by putting the `render*`-functions as close to the dynamic subtree 
as possible.

Let's recap the first reactive rendering example:
```kotlin
render {
    val storedPerson = storeOf(Person(1, "Fritz", 42))

    storedPerson.data.render { person ->
        dl {
            dt { +"Id" }
            dd { +person.id.toString() }
            dt { +"Name" }
            dd { +person.name }
            dt { +"Age" }
            dd { +person.age.toString() }
        }
    }
}
```
This code will recreate the whole `dl`-block when the `storedPerson` state changes, even if only one of its properties 
changes.

Let's analyze how this object might change by looking at each property:
- `id`: this must be stable by definition, so it will never change.
- `name`: name changes are very unlikely.
- `age`: this is in fact the only regularly changing property - each passing year it must be increased.

So we only need to react to changes of one portion of the `Person` model: the `age`-property.

:::info
The following example uses some concepts that have not yet been explained.

The function of [handlers]((/docs/createstores/#custom-handler-in-depth)) and custom
[data-flows](/docs/createstores/#custom-data-flow-property) are explained in the upcoming chapter
[Store Creation](/docs/createstores). We do need to tease these functions here in order to show a working example.
Please accept their function without a deeper understanding of those techniques for now. It's sufficient to
grasp the general concept.
:::

The age being the only attribute likely to change lets us put the reactive rendering code much closer to the 
corresponding UI-elements. As a result, the whole dynamic subtree will become much smaller. This will improve 
performance and reduce memory-usage:
```kotlin
// define a small helper type to hold all static parts of a `Person`
data class StaticPerson(val id: Int, val name: String)

val storedPerson = object : RootStore<Person>(Person(1, "Fritz", 42), job = Job()) {

    // collect all static properties of the person into the helper class object
    val staticPart: Flow<StaticPerson> = data.map { StaticPerson(it.id, it.name) }

    // create specific data flow for the `age`-property
    val age: Flow<Int> = data.map { it.age }

    // For now, just accept that this element will change the store's state.
    // The concept of handlers is described in the next chapter "Creating Stores"
    val increaseAge = handle { state -> state.copy(age = state.age + 1) }
}

render {
    dl {
        storedPerson.staticPart.render { person ->
            //       ^^^^^^^^^^
            //       the upcoming `render`-function will only react to changes to this data part.
            //       as this data won't change, this will be rendered only once!
            dt { +"Id" }
            dd { +person.id.toString() }
            dt { +"Name" }
            dd { +person.name }
            dt { +"Artificial random value to show that this UI part will not react to age changes." }
            dd { +Id.next() } // This changes on re-rendering. It won't change in this app though.
        }
        dt { +"Age" }
        dd {
            storedPerson.age.renderText()
            //           ^^^
            //           Same here: the render function will only react to changes of the `age`-portion
            //           of some `Person`-object. As this might change quite often, this part of the
            //           UI will also change in the same manner.
        }
    }
    button {
        +"Increase Age"
        clicks handledBy storedPerson.increaseAge
    }
}
```

In the above example, the static aspects are exposed via the separate data-flow `staticPart` and will be configured
internally by the `render`-function. The latter will filter out all values which are equal to their predecessors. 
This way, every change to the store's value exposed by its `data`-flow will only appear on this flow if and when 
some relevant properties have changed.

As the example only allows the changing of the `age`-property, which is *not* part of the static-parts, the `staticPart`
flow will not emit a new value, so the mount-point will not re-render ist subtree.

On the other hand, the `age`-property is exposed by some special data-flow `storedPerson.age`. This one will emit a
new value on every change to the main model. The latter is realized by the `<button>`-tag below, which will trigger
a [handler in the store](/docs/createstores/#custom-handler-in-depth) which increases the `Person.age`-property.

As this value is atomic, we want to place the mount-point as deep into the static UI-part as possible. In this case,
directly as text-node inside the `<dd>`-tag. This is quite *precise*, that's why we call this concept 
*precise rendering*.

You can verify the two different behaviours of rendering in the example by clicking the [[Increase Age]]-button.
After each click, a new `Person`-object is created by the handler. The "Age" data will show the increased value, but
the "Artificial random value" remains the same, which proves that the first mount-point does not get an update.

:::info
The above concept applies also to the `renderText`-function or [mapped stores](/docs/storemapping/).
:::

### Minimize DOM Structure of Mount-Points

Let's recap the first reactive rendering example:
```kotlin
render {
    val storedPerson = storeOf(Person(1, "Fritz", 42))

    storedPerson.data.render { person ->
        dl {
            dt { +"Id" }
            dd { +person.id.toString() }
            dt { +"Name" }
            dd { +person.name }
            dt { +"Age" }
            dd { +person.age.toString() }
        }
    }
}
```

As result the following DOM-fragment is rendered:
```html
<div class="mount-point" data-mount-point="">
    <dl>
        <dt>Id</dt>
        <dd>1</dd>
        <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd>Fritz</dd>
        <dt>Age</dt>
        <dd>42</dd>
    </dl>
</div>
```

Since the preliminary `<dl>` tag groups all its child UI-elements, the *artificially* created
`<div>`-tag as mount-point reference to the DOM is overhead. We can improve ths DOM structure by telling the 
`render`-function to *use* an existing tag as mount-point reference instead of creating a dedicated one:

```kotlin
dl {
    // `this` is the <dl>-Tag in this scope
    // pass the existing tag *into* `render` to use it as the mount-point reference 
    storedPerson.data.render(into = this) { person -> 
        dt { +"Id" }
        dd { +person.id.toString() }
        // ...
    }
}
```

As a result, the following reduced DOM-fragment is rendered:
```html
<dl data-mount-point="">
    <dt>Id</dt>
    <dd>1</dd>
    <dt>Name</dt>
    <dd>Fritz</dd>
    <dt>Age</dt>
    <dd>42</dd>
</dl>
```

:::warning
As you know, the mount-point has *full* control over the DOM-subtree below its reference tag and will drop it
completely on every change of the data, so be cautious to **never ever** put other tags around this `render`-expression! 
It will be deleted sooner or later by the mount-point. The two additional `div`s in the following code are located 
inside the `dl`, which is the `this` we put into the render-function, and will thus disappear on re-render.

```kotlin
dl {
    div { +"Do not put any elements between a referenced tag and its related `render` function!" }    
    storedPerson.data.render(into = this) { person -> 
        dt { +"Id" }
        dd { +person.id.toString() }
        // ...
    }
    div { +"Even though this might appear on initial rendering, it will be dropped after first change." }
}
```
:::

In fact all `render*`-variants offer the `into` parameter, so this applies to `renderText` and `renderEach` too.

### Structure UI

It's very easy to create a lightweight reusable component with fritz2. All you have to do is write a function
with `RenderContext` as its receiver type:

```kotlin
fun RenderContext.myComponent() {
    p {
        +"This is the smallest valid stateless component."
    }
}

render {
    myComponent()
}
```

Of course, you can also use a subtype of `RenderContext`, like a `Tag`, as receiver if you want to limit the 
usage of your component to this parent type.

Using plain functions, it's also straight forward to parametrize your component:

```kotlin
fun RenderContext.myOtherComponent(person: Person) {
    p {
        +"Hello, my name is ${person.name}!"
    }
}

val somePerson = Person(...)
render {
    div {
        myOtherComponent(somePerson)
    }
}
```

To allow nested components, use a lambda with `RenderContext` as its receiver, or the type of the element you are
calling the lambda in:

```kotlin
// return an HTML element if you need it
fun RenderContext.container(content: RenderContext.() -> Unit) {
    div("container") {
        content()
    }
}

render {
    container {
        p {
            +"Hello World!"
        }
    }
}
```

Using `Div` as receiver type in the example above allows you to access the specific attributes and events of your
container-element from your content-lambda. Use `RenderContext` where this is not necessary or intended.

### Inline Styles

fritz2 also offers a function for setting the inline `style` attribute to your elements:

```kotlin
render {
    p {
        inlineStyle("color: red")
        +"this is red text"
    }
}
```

Of course, it is also possible to dynamically style an element by passing a `Flow` of CSS styles to `inlineStyle`:
```kotlin
render {
    val enabled = storeOf(true)

    div {
        inlineStyle(enabled.data.map {
            if (it) "background-color: lightgreen;"
            else "opacity: 0.5; background-color: lightgrey;"
        })
        +"Important content"
    }
}
```

## Advanced Topics

### Scope

fritz2 offers the use of `Scope`s to add more information to a tag. It can then be received by any
child-tag of the corresponding DOM-subtree and will not be rendered out by default. The values in the `Scope` are
only available for tags inside the context of the tag which sets them.

To append something to the `Scope`, you have to create a `Scope.Key` by using the
`Scope.keyOf()` function.
```kotlin
val myKey = Scope.keyOf<String>("myKeyName")
```
The key is needed to set or get a value of the `Scope`.
```kotlin
val fooKey = Scope.keyOf<String>("foo")

render {
    div(scope = {
        set(fooKey, "bar")
    }) {
        div {
            // div is child of scope owner, so key is accessible
            +(scope[fooKey] ?: "")
        }
    }
    div {
        // this div is not a child, so key is not in its (empty) scope
        +(scope[fooKey] ?: "")
    }
}
```
The result is the following:
```html
<div>
    <div>bar</div>
</div>
<div></div>
```
For debugging purposes, you can use the `scope.asDataAttr()` function to set the current scope to the tag and see it
in the DOM-Tree.

### Customize the Starting Point - Anchor Your Global Render Function

As you already know, you need to call the global `render` function once in order to create an initial
`RenderContext`:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    render {
        // access to the created root `RenderContext`
        // start your UI code from within here
    }
}
```

This of course only works in combination with a matching `index.html` in the `jsMain/resources`-folder, which is just a
normal web-page. To set it up correctly,
1. there must be one HTML-tag as target reference; by default the `document.body` tag is used.
2. the resulting js-artifact must be included as `<script>` tag beneath the static HTML.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" name="viewport">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="myAppAnchor">
        Loading...
    </div>
    <script src="<project-name>.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

The global `render` factory accepts a 
`selector` string (see [querySelector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector)), 
or alternatively a [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement), 
to select the target HTML-tag:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    render("#myAppAnchor") { // using id selector here, leave blank to use document.body by default
        h1 { +"My App" }
        div("fix-css-class") {
            p(id = "someId") {
                +"Hello World!"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

When calling `render` like that, your content will be mounted to an `HTMLElement` with `id="myAppAnchor"`.
If you want to mount your content to the `body` of your `index.html` instead, you can omit this parameter.

The second option is to set the `override` parameter to `false`, which means that your content will be appended.
By default, all child elements will be removed before your content is appended to the target HTML-tag.

Run the project by calling `./gradlew jsRun` in your project's main directory. Add `-t` to enable automatic
building and reloading in the browser after changing your code.

### Reactive Styling With Complex Rules

fritz2 also lets you manage multiple classes in a `List<String>` or `Flow<List<String>>` with the `classList`-attribute.

Additionally, you can build a `Map<String, Boolean>` from your model data which enables and disables single classes
dynamically:

```kotlin
render {
    div {
        classMap(toDoStore.data.map {
            mapOf(
                "completed" to it.completed, // a boolean-attribute in the data-model
                "editing" to it.editing
            )
        })
    }
}
```
